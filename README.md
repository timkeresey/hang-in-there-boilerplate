## Context

This application is a group project of the first Module of Turing School of Software and Design. As a team we completed this application during the course of 6 days. We use the provided HTML and CSS templates as well as the `poster.js` which contained the poster's class. As a team we decided to create a third file named `data.js` that organized our data structure. Most of the work took place in the `main.js` file where the main functionality was build to complete each iteration.

The Hang-in-there project aims to provide a motivational random poster but it also allows the user to create their own.

### Technologies used:

 * JavaScript
 * Terminal
 * GitHub
 * Google's developer tools

## Challenges

  * DOM manipulation using JavaScript classes
  * Git workflow while working as a team with multiple contributors
  * Writing DRY JavaScript
  *  

## Wins

  * Generate and display random posters
  * Display saved posters
  * Delete mini-posters on `db-click`
  * Event listeners
  * ~Event handlers~

## Future Goals

  * Implement data validation and error handling
  * In the main poster view, allow users to update a newly created poster
  * When a user single clicks a saved poster, create a model to view it larger
  * Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear

## In Action

    * When the user first opens the browser, a new random poster is generated and displayed on the main posters' view.

  <img src=" " alt="The user fills out the New Activity form and a timer appears." height=auto width=75%/>

    * the user clicks 'Start' and the countdown begins
    * once the countdown is complete, the message 'Well Done' appears
    * then the user clicks 'Log Activity' and a new activity card appears below 'Past Activities'

  <img src=" " alt="The user clicks start, the timer counts down, and then they log the activity." height=auto width=75%/>

    * the user clicks 'Create A New Activity' and is brought back to the activity form
    * the user inputs new information and initiates the countdown
    * when the user logs the new activity, it appears with the other past activity

  <img src=" " alt="The user creates and logs a new activity." height=auto width=75%/>

    * in mobile view, the user has all of the same functionality
    * the past activities appear at the bottom instead of to the right

  <img src="" alt="In mobile view, the user creates a new activity and logs the activity." height=auto width=25%/>
